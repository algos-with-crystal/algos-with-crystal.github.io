### Problem Description

You have to climb a staircase that has `n` number of total steps in it. As you climb, you can only climb `step` steps at a time where `step` is a member of an array `k`. Determine all the possible ways you can climb the stairs up to `n`.
For simplicity sake, you can consider that `k` may contain duplicate but your solution can treat them as unique regardless.


### Example

Input: `n=4`, `k=[2]`
Output: `1` Since you can take 2 steps and then again 2 steps.

Input: `n=4`, `k=[1,2]`
Output: `5` Since the possible ways are `[1,1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,2], [2,1,1]`

### Thought Process

Imagine yourself climbing the stairs and making choices as you ascend. At any point of the ascend, regardless whether you're at the bottom of the stairs or somewhere in middle, you have `k` possibilities to choose from for your next move.

```
for each number step in array k:
  ascend step steps
```

For each step you take, there are 3 possible outcomes. The step takes you exactly at the top, in which case you've found one of the solutions. If you've not reached the top of the stairs yet, you will have to continue the process. And if you go beyond the top of the stairs, then you can stop moving forward as conclude that the specific combination you took isn't a viable solution.

```
for each number step in array k:
  ascend step steps
  if reached top exactly:
    found a solution
  else if top is not reached yet:
    continue exploring
```

The following solution below takes a recursive approach using a helper function.


### Solution
<small>[source code](https://github.com/algos-with-crystal/algos-with-crystal.github.io/blob/master/lib/staircase_steps_permutation.cr#L1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}</small>


```ruby
def climb(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32))
    return climb(n, k, n)
end

private def climb(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32), remaining_steps : Int32)
    count = 0

    k.each do |step|
        new_remaining_steps = remaining_steps - step
        if new_remaining_steps == 0
            count += 1
        elsif new_remaining_steps > 0
            count += climb(n, k, new_remaining_steps)
        end
    end

    count
end
```

In each iteration, there are `k` possibilities. For each value in `k`, the next level of iteration has `k` more possibilities. So it renders a tree like structure where each leaf has `k` items. The max depth for the tree is `n`, thus it has a runtime of <code>O(k<sup>n</sup>)</code>. It is the same concept as a binary tree, except there are `k` possibilities instead of just two.

While this works, there is a possible optimization. Anytime you find out there are `x` ways to climb `p` steps, you can store that value and reuse it anytime you need to solve for total ways to climb `p` more steps again. This should reduce your runtime to `O(n*k)` with a memory footprint of `O(n)`.

```ruby
def climb_with_memoization(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32))
    return climb_with_memoization(n, k, n, {} of Int32 => Int32)
  end

private def climb_with_memoization(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32), remaining_steps : Int32, memory : Hash(Int32, Int32))
    if memory.has_key? remaining_steps
        return memory[remaining_steps]
    end
  
    count = 0

    k.each do |step|
        new_remaining_steps = remaining_steps - step
        if new_remaining_steps == 0
            count += 1
            memory[new_remaining_steps] = count
        elsif new_remaining_steps > 0
            count += climb_with_memoization(n, k, new_remaining_steps, memory)
        end
    end

    count
end
```

And you can also trace the solutions.

```ruby
def climb_with_memoization_trace(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32))  
    return climb_with_memoization_trace(n, k, n, {} of Int32 => Int32, [] of Int32)
end

private def climb_with_memoization_trace(n : Int32, k : Array(Int32), remaining_steps : Int32, memory : Hash(Int32, Int32), trace)
    if memory.has_key? remaining_steps
        return memory[remaining_steps]
    end
  
    count = 0
    k.each do |step|
        new_remaining_steps = remaining_steps - step
        if new_remaining_steps == 0
            count += 1
            memory[new_remaining_steps] = count
            puts (trace + [step])
        elsif new_remaining_steps > 0
            trace << step
            count += climb_with_memoization_trace(n, k, new_remaining_steps, memory, trace)
            trace.pop()
        end
    end

    count
end
```
